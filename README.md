## ü§ñ | How to run our system:

Because our system was designed to make it easy to run tests, all you need to do is run the following command within our root project directory:

```
python3 run.py
```

If you want a custom execution, altering some default options, take a look at the options that we provide to you by running the previous command with the flag *help*:

```
python3 run.py --help
```

Keep in mind that the rendering option may take a while to finish and show the results of that execution.
For example, you may only want to see fast the results of each team without saving them:
```
python3 run.py --episodes 100 --no-rendering --show-results --no-save-results --max-generation-steps 50 --occupancy-map 4 --stressfulness 2
```

## ‚úç | How to configure our system:

We also provide a unique configuration file - ```settings.py``` - which you can use to change some settings of our ERS environment, such as:

* The scenario style colors and the resource package path.
* Request priority probabilities and durations.
* Definition of occupancy map layouts for request generation. You can modify some of them according to our needs and finds.
